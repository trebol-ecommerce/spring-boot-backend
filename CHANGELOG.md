## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Issue and Pull Request templates
- [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org) file
  - Enforces Unix-style line endings (LF)
- `PhoneNumber` annotation for validating phone numbers - **Thank you `@mepox`**
  - Use custom `PhoneNumberValidator`, subclass of `javax.validation.ValidationConstraint`, which validates using regular expression
  - Configure the regular expression through `trebol.validation.phonenumber-regexp` in `application.properties`
- Account protection mechanism by `user_id` - **Thank you `@mepox`**
  - Any attempt to delete one certain user account will be cancelled
  - The protected user account must have the same `id` indicated by `trebol.security.protected-account-id` in `application.properties`

### Changed

- [WIP] **BREAKING CHANGE** Split logic in services that implement `ICrudJpaService<P>` and extend `GenericCrudJpaService<P, E>`
  - Introduce `IDataTransportJpaService<P, E>` to keep specific domain-dependant boilerplate code for updating entities before they are submitted to database
    - This new, separate interface inherits the `applyChangesToExistingEntity` method from `ITwoWayConverterJpaService<P, E>`
    - The original method in `ITwoWayConverterJpaService` has been deprecated
  - Break down the steps taken on each method in the public API of `GenericCrudJpaService` and its sub-implementations, by introducing these overridable `protected` methods 
    - `prepareEntityWithUpdatesFromPojo`
    - `validateInputPojoBeforeCreation`
    - `prepareNewEntityFromInputPojo`
  - Introduce sub-interfaces from `ICrudJpaService<P, E`, `IDataTransportJpaService<P, E>` and `ITwoWayConverterJpaService<P, E>`
    - This increases the accuracy of type-safe dependency injection. Specially important for unit testing and mocks.
- UsersConverterJpaServiceImpl - refactor `convertToNewEntity` since it tag as cyclomatic issue
- SalesConverterJpaServiceImpl, SalesProcessServiceImpl - add string constants
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Rename table names to follow the naming convention - **Thank you `@mepox`**
    - `products_categories`          -> `product_categories`
    - `products_images`              -> `product_images`
    - `sales_statuses`               -> `sell_statuses`
    - `app_users_roles`              -> `app_user_roles`
    - `app_users_roles_permissions`  -> `app_user_role_permissions`
- Update GitHub Actions workflow
  - `actions/checkout`      | `v2 -> `v3`
  - `actions/setup-java`    | `v1 -> `v3`
    - Following [Switching to V2](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/blob/v3.6.0/docs/switching-to-v2.md) guide

### Fixed

## [v3.0.0.rc-1] - 2022-08-18

### Added
- Support sorting product lists by item count (the amount of products held on each)
- Properties to configure the guest user (a public account only enabled for checking out)
  - `trebol.security.guestUserEnabled` - Can be true or false
  - `trebol.security.guestUserName` - Any non-blank string; also acts as its password
- Property to configure max allowed nested depth while fetching categories
- *BREAKING CHANGE*: `SellDetail` entity now has a `description` field, which is meant to describe and summarize the detail in a human-readable format
- When fetching data, filters by category may include descendant of lower level categories
  - For example, assumming that category A includes subcategories AB and AC, filtering 'by category A' may include children from subcategories AB and AC as well 
  - This applies for filtering categories and products
  - Behavior before was to fetch only direct descendants of a given category
- Implement three API resources to interact with sales after a checkout process from the customer
  - `/data/sales/confirmation` - To confirm the sell (when logistics is good to go)
  - `/data/sales/rejection` - To reject the sell (for cases such as, when no stock is available)
  - `/data/sales/completion` - To complete the sell, or otherwise mark it as delivered
- Introduce a service interface for sending notification mails to customers and owners alike during checkout steps
  - Include Mailgun HTTP API implementation
    - To use it, the `mailgun` spring profile should be active
    - An empty configuration file is provided

### Changed
- Use [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) 
- The transaction token for the (frontend) checkout result page  is passed through query param instead of path param
- Default `GET /data/sales` sort order is by descending `buyOrder`
- (Temporary) Disable regex pattern validation for phone numbers
- Further divide logic for sorting/pagination/filtering into different services
- Bump dependencies
  - `spring-boot-starter-parent` from `2.6.2` to `2.6.4`
  - `h2database` from `inherited` to `2.1.212`
  - `jjwt-*` from `0.11.2` to `0.11.5`
  - `unirest-java` from `3.13.6` to `3.13.8`

- Bump plugins
  - `jacoco-maven-plugin` from `0.8.5` to `0.8.8`

### Fixed
- Incorrect amount value given to Webpay (net value instead of total value)
- Two very important equations when calculating sell totals
- Incorrect protocol for MariaDB JDBC URL
- Webpay Plus was unable to redirect users to the callback URL; added `null` in list of allowed CORS origins
- Incongruent binding of query parameters to data search filters for products
- Guest can call the `/access` API and be returned a `200 OK` response
- Support for fetching an individual sell data (details included) when requested with `buyOrder` query param
- Change integration type for payments with Webpay Plus when production mode is not enabled
  - Now uses `TEST` as recommended by `@TransbankDevelopers`
  - Was using `MOCK` which is not very well documented
